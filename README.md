# 🛒 Supermarket Sales Analysis (SQL + Python)

## Overview
This project explores customer behavior, product sales, and store performance using a supermarket sales dataset. The data was initially ingested and cleaned using Python, then analyzed through a series of SQL queries. Insights focus on demographic trends, high-performing products, and geographical sales distributions.

## 🧠 Technologies Used
- **Python**: for CSV ingestion and data preprocessing
- **MySQL**: for executing relational queries across multiple tables
- **Pandas & CSV Libraries**: for loading and manipulating raw data (Python)
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn (optional)**: for potential visualizations

## 📂 Dataset Structure
The dataset was split across tables:
- `customers`: gender, customer type, invoice ID
- `products`: product line, unit price, quantity, invoice ID
- `sales`: total, gross income, invoice ID
- `stores`: branch, city, invoice ID
## 📊 General Analysis & Interpretation ##
This section explores overarching trends uncovered through SQL queries and supported by visualizations. The goal is to interpret key customer behaviors, regional patterns, and product performance, revealing business-relevant insights.

- Suggests opportunity for app-based incentives or streamlining mobile checkout.
### 📦 Product Line Performance ###
- Electronic Accessories and Food & Beverages topped overall sales.
- These may represent utility-driven purchases (tech essentials) versus necessity items (daily consumption).
- Further analysis using quantity vs. average spend can segment buyers into value-driven vs. indulgent consumers.
### 🧾 Transaction Highlights ###
- Repeated high-quantity invoices suggest bulk-buying behavior, particularly within top-selling product lines.
- Individual invoices linked to high unit prices reveal luxury transactions in categories like Fashion Accessories and Health & Beauty.
### 🏬 Store & Regional Strengths ###
- Yangon was the top-performing city, with the highest total sales.
- Branch A led in item sales, suggesting strong foot traffic or inventory strategy.
- These patterns support regional market segmentation and targeted inventory optimization.
### 📈 Financial Summary ###
- Gross income totaled $15,380.05, showing consistent profitability across branches.
- Pairing this figure with top categories and customer profiles builds a clearer picture of what's driving revenue.
